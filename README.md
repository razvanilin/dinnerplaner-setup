Interaction Programing - Lab assignment - HTML
=================================================

## Raz's test notes

Careful with the navigation, it can be done in multiple ways and my tests follow the navigation done by the students of this group.


What's in the project
-----

* [index.html](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/dinnerplanner-html/blob/master/index.html) - the only HTML page you will have in this project (though while testing you can create more to make it easier). You will need to implement the skeleton of the layout there and then through code (JavaScript) create the rest
* [js/model/dinnerModel.js](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/dinnerplanner-html/blob/master/js/model/dinnerModel.js) - is JavaScript file that contains the model code. The file contains the model (dish, ingredient and general dinner model) as well as methods and comments that you need to fully implement to support the dinner functionalities (guests, selected dishes, etc.)
* [js/view/](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/dinnerplanner-html/tree/master/js/view) - here you can find a JavaScript code of an example view. The view sets up some initial components and their values.
* [js/app.js](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/dinnerplanner-html/blob/master/js/app.js) - this is the overall code of the application. It is responsible for initial setup of the app (when the page loads for the first time).
* [images/](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/dinnerplanner-html/tree/master/images) - folder contains some pictures you can use for your dishes


Installation
-----

* [js/config_template.js](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/dinnerplanner-html/blob/master/js/config_template.js) - rename this file config.js and add the SPOONACULAR_API_KEY
